In [this repository](https://github.com/Olezha83/reverse-string) I described few ways to reverse a string.

At first I thought that it would be enough to compare original and reversed strings to check if a word is a palindrome.
Through testing, I realized that this only works fine for checking a single word, not a phrase or a sentence.
I realized, that in order to check a phrase or a sentence it is also necessary to remove spaces and punctuation.
That's what I did in second and third commit.

[Here](https://github.com/Olezha83/react-palindrome) is the React analogue of this app
